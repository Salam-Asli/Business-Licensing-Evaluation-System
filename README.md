ðŸ“‘ AI Usage

Model: GPT-4 (via OpenAI API)
Purpose: Generate a customized report based on user input
Process:
Frontend sends formData + applicableRules to backend
Backend passes the data to the LLM
The model returns a clear, readable report
The report is displayed in the frontend


Innovation & Creativity
Using an LLM to transform regulatory/legal text into simple business language.
Full personalization according to business data.
Future extension: PDF export, risk scoring, or recommendation system.


API Documentation: 
POST /generate_report
Input: JSON object with user answers + applicable regulations
Output: JSON with generated report text
Example: 
   {
  "formData": {
    "size": "small",
    "seats": 25
  },
  "regulations": [
    {"id": 2, "requirement": "×ž×¡×¤×¨ ×ž×§×•×ž×•×ª ×™×©×™×‘×”"},
    {"id": 3, "requirement": "×—×•×‘×” ×œ×“×•×•×— ×¢×œ ×©×™×ž×•×© ×‘×’×–"}
  ]
}
Response: 
{
  "id": Number,
  "requirement": String,
  "appliesTo": [ { "size": String, "seats": Number } ]
}


Matching Algorithm
Filter regulations based on:
Business size
Number of seats
Special attributes ( gas usage)
Return only relevant rules to the user.
